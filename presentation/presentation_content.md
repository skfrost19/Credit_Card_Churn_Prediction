## Slide 4: Data Cleaning & Quality Issues

### Initial Data Inconsistencies
- **Missing Values:** Several columns contained null values that required imputation.
- **Inconsistent 'Churn' values:** The target column had multiple representations for churn, including `2.0`, `2`, and `'Maybe'`, which needed standardization.
- **Categorical Data Issues:** Features like 'Gender' had extra whitespace, and 'HasCrCard'/'IsActiveMember' had mixed data types.

### Data Cleaning Steps
1.  **Handled Missing Values:** Filled with mean for numerical and mode for categorical features.
2.  **Standardized Target Variable:** Mapped all churn variations to `0` (No Churn) or `1` (Churn), and removed ambiguous entries.
3.  **Cleaned Categorical Features:** Trimmed whitespace and enforced consistent data types.
4.  **Outlier Removal:** Applied the IQR method to identify and remove outliers from key numerical columns, ensuring data quality.
